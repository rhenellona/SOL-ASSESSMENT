# Solidity Beginnner Course Assessment

Final project for the fullfillment of ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course.

## Description

In this project, we are asked to create our own tokens with the following requirements.

## Process
So for the first requirement, my contract should have public variables that store the details about my coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)

``` sol
contract MyToken {

    string public TokenName = "BRAVE";
    string public TokenAbbrv = "BRVE";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;
```
